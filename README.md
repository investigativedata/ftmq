# ftmq

This library provides methods to query and filter entities formatted as [Follow The Money](https://followthemoney.tech) data, either from a json file/stream or using a statement-based store backend from [nomenklatura](https://github.com/opensanctions/nomenklatura).

It also provides a `Query` class that can be used in other libraries to work with SQL store queries or api queries.

`ftmq` is the base layer for [investigativedata.io's](https://investigativedata.io) libraries and applications dealing with [Follow The Money](https://followthemoney.tech) data.

To get familiar with the _Follow The Money_ ecosystem, you can have a look at [this pad here](https://pad.investigativedata.org/s/0qKuBEcsM#).
